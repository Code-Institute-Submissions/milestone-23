# Coockbook

This website was created to help people store they recipes in one place. It's easy to use, you can add, update, remove and read other peoples recipes.
I created this website as a showcase of the skills learned through the Fullstack Software Developer Course by Code Institute.

## Deployed site

## UX 

The site is easy to use, fully responsive and allows users to create, update, read, and delete recipes from the database connected to the site.
It's an easy way to store your recipes all in one place. To find new ones added by other people.

### Research

To create an easily understandable website I looked up a few sites with the similar topic and built my site in the similar way.

## Features

### Functionality

* The user can browse from the recipes database, they can Add / Remove / Update recipes. The site is connected to MongoDB.
* The site is responsive and fully scalable.
* With the search bar the user can easily find a recipe in the database

### Features left to implement

* User login and register. Now anyone can add/delete from the recipes which is a bit dangerous :) .
* Add favourite buttons to the recipes, so when the user returns to the site can search by favourites.
* Add a comment section to the recepies, so people can add addittional comments.
* Shop page would need more improvements and data but because the lack of time I focused on the functionality of the site.

## Technologies Used 
* Python 3
* Flask 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Materialize
* MongodDB
* Heroku
* Git 
* FontAwesome
* AWS Cloud9
* gitpod

## Testing

* The testing of the site was manually conducted. All the CRUD features work as expected.
* The responsiveness of the site could be imporved, but is acceptable like this.
**Ux Stories**
* Adding recipes : Working as expected, all the data entered by the user is pushed to Mongo database.
* Reading recipes : Working as expected, all the data previously entered is loading properly from tha database.
* Editing recipes : Working as expected, the changes made by the user is then updated in the database.
* Deleting recepies: Working as expected, the chosen recepe is deleted from the database.
**Different Browsers**
* I checked the site on the most popular browsers and they seem to be working good.
* On phone screen should be a bit more adjusted, but it's working.

## Deployment 

* The webpage is deployed using Heroku web services.
* I used Github for version control and hosting page.
